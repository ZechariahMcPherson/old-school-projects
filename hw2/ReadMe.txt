In my main.pl file is my driver. If you run "make" and then "./Movie" all of the answers to the queries will show up. It isn't pretty but Mr. Hein said it was okay. If you don't want to run the driver then you can just enter the main.pl and it will show all of my queries that I ran. Thanks for your time have a great day :)
